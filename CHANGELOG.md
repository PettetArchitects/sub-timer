# Sub Timer — Changelog

All notable changes to the app, by version. The in-app "What's New" modal pulls the same data from `CHANGELOG_DATA` in `sub-timer.html`.

## v1.9.1-beta — In-game control dashboard

- 🎛️ **Action dashboard** under the timer — **Swap / Keeper / Injury / Undo** in one persistent control bar, instead of hidden tap-gestures.
- ↔️ **Swap** — tap two players to exchange positions. Sets the starting line-up before kickoff and reshuffles mid-game.
- 🧤 **Keeper** — tap a player to make them goalkeeper on the fly (GK role transfers, old keeper takes their slot).
- 🚑 **Injury** — tap the injured player, the bench lights up, tap exactly who comes on (no longer forced to the front of the queue). "Out for game" option preserved.
- ↩️ **Undo** surfaced as a dashboard button (disabled when there's nothing to revert).
- ✨ **Subtle soft-UI pass** — consistent corner radii, soft drop shadows + faint top highlight, gentle gradients and tactile press states across buttons, chips and cards. Reads premium without heavy neumorphism.

### Architecture notes
- `gameMode` ('swap' | 'keeper' | 'injury') drives what tapping a player does; `setGameMode()` toggles it (tapping the active mode returns to the safe Swap default).
- `tapFieldPlayer()` branches on mode; `tapBenchForInjury()` completes the injury flow with the chosen replacement; `makeKeeper()` reuses `swapFieldPositions()` for the role transfer.
- `injurySub(pIdx, replacementIdx)` now takes an optional chosen replacement, defaulting to `bench[0]`.
- Soft-UI tokens: `--r-btn/--r-chip/--r-sm` radii, `--sh-raise/--sh-raise-lg/--sh-press` shadows. Applied to `.btn*`, `.chip*`, `.card`, `.gd-btn`.

## v1.9-beta — 3D pitch + jersey pills

- 🎯 **Soccer pitch in 3D perspective** — bottom-pivoted 45° tilt with depth foreshortening (broadcast-cam feel). Near edge anchors the layout so the far end tapers inward without clipping.
- 👕 **Jersey-shirt player pills** — each player is an outlined shirt (light fill) with their number ON the shirt; position chip + name on a pill below. GK shirt is **pink** (distinct from amber "about to sub").
- ✋ **Set the line-up on the pitch** — before kickoff, tap two players to swap their starting positions. Works for outfield players and the GK (role transfers). After kickoff, tapping a player is an injury sub as before.
- 🪑 **Bench as a wave grid** — Next on / +5′ / +10′ columns (sized off sub interval × players-per-sub). Auto-fits more columns for big benches (AFL-ready).
- ↩️ **Undo Last Sub** surfaced in the bench header — instantly reverts a mistaken swap.
- ✏️ **Heavier line work** + removed the distracting centre/penalty dots.
- 📐 FIFA-correct dimensions preserved — penalty area 40.32×16.5m, goal area 18.32×5.5m, centre circle r=9.15m, penalty spot 11m, corner arc r=1m, goal mouth 7.32m.

### Architecture notes
- `.pitch-flex` (flex:1) holds `.lu-pitch` absolutely-centred (`inset:0; margin:auto; aspect-ratio:105/80; max-width/height:100%`) — fits the largest aspect-correct box in the available space, no scroll.
- `.lu-plane` is the tilted ground (`rotateX(45deg)`, `transform-origin:50% 100%`, `height:240%`) containing the SVG; calibrated so the perspective-projected plane fills the container.
- `pitchPt(px, py)` mirrors the CSS bottom-pivot + perspective matrix in JS; falls back to identity (raw px/py) if `_pitchDims` is unset OR has zero width/height — guarantees tokens never disappear on first paint.
- `tapFieldPlayer()` branches on `G.secs===0 && !G.running` → position swap, else injury sub. `swapFieldPositions()` swaps slots in `G.on`, transfers the GK role, and keeps paired-rotation groups consistent.
- Netball stays top-down (existing CSS-based markings); identity fallback in `pitchPt` when `_pitchDims` is null.

## v1.8-beta — Full Control mode + Game Plan view

- 📋 **New "Full control" sub strategy** — coach plans every sub before kickoff
- 🪄 **Auto-suggested plan** using Equal-time fairness — coach starts with a sensible default rather than a blank slate
- ✏️ **Tap any swap to override** — modal picks alternate off/on players from those on field / bench at that moment
- 📷 **Snap a photo of your handwritten plan** — `extract-roster` edge function extended with a `plan` mode that returns structured `{start, events, gk}` JSON. Fuzzy-matches handwritten names to the roster.
- 🧠 **Strategy descriptions lead with the coach archetype** — stance lines ("I just want everyone to play", "Keep my pairs together", "I'll call them as I see them", "I plan every sub before kickoff") above the algorithm description
- ⚙️ At runtime, `trigSub` honours the plan's off/on for the current half + time; falls back to Equal-time logic when no planned event matches (e.g. mid-cycle manual SUB)
- ☁️ Plan is copied from `cfg.subPlan` to `G.subPlan` at game start and snapshotted with the active-game save
- 📷 **Roster photo import now also captures position labels + jersey numbers** — handwritten "Lucy D" / "Maya CD" / "Tilly M" type entries auto-tag the player on save. C-prefix maps to `side='B'`; L/R prefix maps to side. Falls back to name-only if no labels are visible.
- 🔤 New `translateRosterPosition()` helper handles the abbreviations: D/CD/LB/RB/CB → DEF, M/CM/LM/RM → MID, W/LW/RW/WNG → WNG, S/F/FW/ST/FWD → FWD, GK → GK

### Architecture notes
- `generateAutoPlan()` simulates whole-game timeline minute-by-minute crediting minutes, picking highest-min on-field to come off and lowest-min benched to come on at each scheduled sub time
- Edge function `extract-roster` accepts `mode: 'plan'` with optional `roster` hint for name matching; `high` image detail used in plan mode for handwriting recognition
- Plan stale flag (`cfg.subPlanStale`) triggers regeneration when Sub Strategy or interval settings change

## v1.7-beta — Jersey numbers

- 🔢 **Per-player jersey number** — small input on each row in the team editor (all sports)
- 🔢 **Displayed on pitch cards + bench rows** at runtime so coaches can call players by number
- 🔢 **Optional** — leave blank for kids without fixed jerseys, no impact
- ☁ New `numbers` JSONB column on cloud `teams` table; merge logic preserves the richer side, same pattern as positions / sides / foots
- 📝 Rename + delete handlers migrate the numbers key alongside everything else

---

## v1.6-beta — Player side + foot preferences

- 🦶 **Per-player side preference** (L / R / Both) — captured in the team editor for soccer teams
- 🦶 **Per-player dominant foot** (L / R / Both) — a right-footer often prefers playing left to cut inside, so we keep these as separate fields
- 🆕 Open any existing team's editor to fill these in — defaults are "Both" so old teams aren't broken
- 🏐 Soccer only — netball positions are fixed by rule, no side concept
- ☁ New `sides` + `foots` JSONB columns on the cloud `teams` table; merge logic preserves the richer side
- 📝 Rename + delete handlers migrate side/foot keys alongside positions

---

## v1.5-beta — Sync hardening + smarter score handling

- 🛡 **Position tags no longer get wiped when syncing across devices** — the cloud merge now preserves whichever side has data
- 🛡 **Players added offline are preserved** on sync — the longer list wins
- 🎯 **Sub strategy + GK settings** are correctly preserved across sync
- ✓ **Tap −1 on the score** to correct a fat-finger goal — match log stays clean (no phantom goals)

- 🏐 **Legacy netball teams** now correctly identified by format (no more soccer ball icon on netball cards)
- 🏷 **Version tag** visible next to the BETA pill (header + landing hero)
- 📐 "Next sub at" time on the game screen — slightly bigger so it's easier to glance
- ✨ **What's New modal** introduced — you're looking at it

---

## v1.4-beta — Undo + reorder + futsal

- 🔄 **Paired rotation now balances minutes** — the pair with the most game time goes off, keeping groups together AND minutes fair
- 🕐 **Whole-game continuous sub schedule** — sub cadence flows continuously across both halves rather than restarting each period
- 🥅 **Custom soccer ball icon** with proper pentagon-centre geometry
- 🏐 **Custom netball icon** with proper volleyball-style seam pattern
- ⚽ **Futsal 5v5 format** — 4 outfield + 1 GK, 2-minute hockey-style line rotations, 1-2-1 diamond default

## How to update this file

Append a new section at the top when bumping `APP_VERSION` in `sub-timer.html`. Mirror the change list into `CHANGELOG_DATA` near the top of the JS so the in-app **What's New** modal shows the same entries when users open the app on the new version.
